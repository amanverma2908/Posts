## Operating System - History

The first Operating System was created by General Motors in 1956 to run a single IBM mainframe computer, its name was the IBM 704. IBM was the first computer manufacturer to develop operating systems and distribute them in its computers in the 1960s.

- Stanford Research Institute developed the oN-Line System (NLS) in the late 1960s, which was the first operating system that resembled the desktop operating system we use today.
- Microsoft bought QDOS (Quick and Dirty Operating System) in 1981 and branded it as Microsoft Operating System (MS-DOS). As of 1994, Microsoft had stopped supporting MS-DOS.
- Unix was developed in the mid-1960s by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, AT&T Bell Labs, and General Electric as a joint effort. Initially it was named MULTICS, which stands for Multiplexed Operating and Computing System.
- FreeBSD is also a popular UNIX derivative, originating from the BSD project at Berkeley. All modern Macintosh computers run a modified version of FreeBSD (OS X).
- Windows 95 is a consumer-oriented graphical user interface-based operating system built on top of MS-DOS. It was released on August 24, 1995 by Microsoft as part of its Windows 9x family of operating systems.
